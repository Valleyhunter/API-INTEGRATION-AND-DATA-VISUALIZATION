In modern web development, API Integration and Data Visualization are two of the most essential components. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow applications to communicate with external services, exchange information, and perform complex tasks without needing to build everything from scratch. On the other hand, data visualization helps in transforming raw data into meaningful insights by representing it visually through charts, graphs, and dashboards.

For this project, the aim is to fetch real-time data from an external API and then present it in an interactive and user-friendly manner using various data visualization techniques
